# Phase 1: Linux Command Line CTF Challenge

Test your Linux command line skills with 18 progressive Capture The Flag challenges. All flags follow the format `CTF{some_text_here}`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please complete [Phase 1 Guide](https://learntocloud.guide/phase/1) before attempting these challenges. Do not share solutions publicly - focus on sharing your learning journey instead.

## Challenges

> **⏱️ Expected time:** 3-4 hours to complete all challenges

| # | Challenge | Description | Difficulty | Skills |
|---|-----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | The Hidden File | Find and read a hidden file in `ctf_challenges` | ⭐ | Hidden files, `ls` |
| 2 | The Secret File | Locate a file containing "secret" in its name under your home directory | ⭐ | File searching, `find` |
| 3 | The Largest Log | Find and read an unusually large file in `/var/log` | ⭐⭐ | File sizes, log navigation |
| 4 | The User Detective | Another user has a flag in their login configuration | ⭐⭐ | User management, UIDs |
| 5 | The Permissive File | Find a suspicious file with wide-open permissions under `/opt` | ⭐⭐ | Permissions |
| 6 | The Hidden Service | Something is listening on port 8080. Connect to it | ⭐⭐ | Networking, ports |
| 7 | The Encoded Secret | Find and decode an encoded flag in `ctf_challenges` | ⭐⭐ | Base64, encoding |
| 8 | SSH Key Authentication | Configure SSH key authentication and find a hidden flag | ⭐⭐ | SSH configuration |

**Difficulty:** ⭐ Beginner | ⭐⭐ Intermediate | ⭐⭐⭐ Advanced

## Get Started

Deploy your CTF lab using your preferred cloud provider:

| Provider | Cost for ~4 hours | Setup Guide |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| AWS | ~$0.01 (Free Tier eligible) | [AWS Setup](./aws/README.md) |
| Azure | ~$0.05 | [Azure Setup](./azure/README.md) |
| GCP | ~$0.03 | [GCP Setup](./gcp/README.md) |

## Completing the CTF

Once you've solved all 18 challenges, export your completion certificate:

```bash
verify export <your-github-username>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Enter your GitHub username **exactly** as it appears on GitHub—no `@` symbol, no extra spaces, no special characters. For example: `verify export octocat` not `verify export @octocat`.

Save the token it generates — you'll need it to verify your progress at [learntocloud.guide/phase1](https://learntocloud.guide/phase1).

### Timer and progress behavior

- `verify time` shows **wall clock elapsed time** (not active keyboard time).
- The timer starts when you first submit a challenge with `verify <number> <flag>`.
- Progress tracks 19 total checks: the example verification plus the 18 real challenges.
- After `verify 0 CTF{example}`, `verify progress` should show `1/19`.
- The timer freezes on your first successful `verify export` after you've solved all 18 real challenges.

### Troubleshooting Your Token

Some terminals truncate long lines when copying. If your token isn't being accepted, it may be incomplete. The full token should be around **300+ characters**.

1. **Check the length:**
   ```bash
   verify export <your-github-username> 2>/dev/null | sed -n '/BEGIN/,/END/{/BEGIN\|END/d;p}' | wc -c
   ```
   If the result is less than 300, your terminal is truncating the token.

2. **Save it to a file:**
   ```bash
   verify export <your-github-username> 2>/dev/null | sed -n '/BEGIN/,/END/{/BEGIN\|END/d;p}' > ~/token.txt
   ```

3. **Open in nano and compare:**
   ```bash
   nano ~/token.txt
   ```
   `nano` will word-wrap properly. Does it match what you see in terminal? If it's longer in `nano`, your terminal was truncating it — use the full value from `nano`.

4. **Still not working?** Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/learntocloud/linux-ctfs/issues) with the output of `wc -c ~/token.txt`.

## Tips

- Use `man` pages to learn commands (e.g., `man find`)
- Combine commands with pipes (`|`) to process output
- Use `verify hint [num]` when stuck on a challenge
- Experiment freely—you can't break anything permanently

## Getting Help / Reporting Issues

If you're having trouble deploying or accessing the lab (Terraform errors, cloud permissions, SSH issues, the `verify` command not working), please **open a GitHub issue**:

https://github.com/learntocloud/linux-ctfs/issues

To help us troubleshoot quickly, include:

- Cloud provider (AWS/Azure/GCP) and region/zone
- Your OS and terminal (Windows/macOS/Linux, WSL, etc.)
- `terraform version`
- CLI status/output confirming you're authenticated (`aws sts get-caller-identity`, `az account show`, or `gcloud auth list --filter=status:ACTIVE`)
- The command you ran and the **exact error output** (redact any secrets)
- Whether the failure is during `terraform apply`, SSH connection, or inside the VM (e.g., `verify progress`)
- If SSH works but the lab is not ready, check `/var/log/ctf_setup.log`, `/var/lib/cloud/instance/ctf-setup.done`, `/var/lib/linux-ctfs/setup.done`, and `/var/lib/linux-ctfs/setup.failed`
